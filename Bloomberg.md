# What do you know about Bloomberg?
    - Bloomberg is a media and financial data and analytics and services company.
    - The company generates most of it's revenue from subscriptions and fees associated with Bloomberg terminals
    - as well as a variety of other services including Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Business, focused on venture capital, brokerage, and more.

### Why Do you want to work at Bloomberg?
    - Well foremost it's because of the job description. I talked to a Senior Dev at Bloomberg Yena and she was told me about the internal tools she developed.
    - and when she talked about the need to love data, the use of promise.all()s I was hooked  because it is the reason and taught myself coding
    - and why i built the 3 internal apps i mentioned in my free time even when it was not my job description.
    - and I find great joy and fullillment in talking and listening to a variety of people and being able to solve problems for people.
    - sometime big problems are so unruly but these small cases I have a lot of confidence and experience solving.

# Tell me about recent financial news
    - Recently Trump launched DWAC(Digital World Acquisition Corp), a social media firm ,which recently gained a lot of  value from meme-ry and linger emotions.
    - I think this kind of buying on volatility and lack of fundamentals is dangerous and we are seeing this trend more and more with AMC and GameStop.
    - This sort of behaviour is being promoted through sites like reddit and twitter and I think it is something Bloomberg should take note of
    - because retail buyers may start shying away from established new sources for none traditional one if money can be made from following reddit.

# What is OOP
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.
    The 4 pillars are: Encapsulation,Abstraction,Inheritance, and Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation is accomplished when each object maintains a private state, inside a class. Other objects can not access this state directly, instead, they can only invoke a list of public functions.
    - Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It is the process of selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object.
    - Inheritance is the ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object.
    - Polymorphism gives us a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types.

### Tell me about yourself.
    - I'm a graduate of Univeristy of Illinois with a Bachelor in Accounting and Minor In Finance.  After college I took a Data Analyst Role at Quidsi Amazon and learned the e-commerce business and grew my passion for data. 2 years later started my own retail abritrage business where I deployed data to gain a competitive edge. ( I can talk about this more if you like) After about 7 years, I sold that business and started working at LG where I taught myself Python, Data Science, got my Six Sigma Black Belt and created 3 main internal tools ONE for invoice management, ANOTHER for leadtime and carrier tracking and ANOTHER for warehouse container tracking.
    - I realized that I had a real knack for coding and decided to join A/a and Iam now looking for that coding job where i can do the work that inspired my journey.

### Tell me about a conflict you had.
    - I had my VP tell me when their is any dispute in business you simply go fact based of course that has some wrinkles.
    - I has a conflict with the owner of a company. I was in charge of essentially running the business.
    - We were headed towards trouble because of changing business environment. (I can elaborate if you like.)
    - so I did presentations and talked to him personally about the changes we need to make.
    - He would agree and say thing like if only i was 10 years younger but what i didn't understand was that he deeply wanted to retire
    - so changing and spending money was not something he wanted to do even if he knew it was what he needed to do.
    - In this case I had to learn to make best of a losing situation and learn to be okay with not winning.

    - Thing about conflict is that you can explain the fact and then beyond that you can only do your best and understand people's perspective

### What is your greatest Strength
    - My greatest strength is ability to listen deeply and keep an open mind. As a busines owner I had to be adaptive, be detailed oriented and be willing to hear hard truths.
    - For example, my employee would ask me what to do and I would say "everything is case by case" which for me meant dont assume anything and try to see the problem and understand deeply.

### What is your greatest Weakness
    - My greatest weakness is my hatred of losing/failing. Sometimes I would fail my a small amount and I would then sort of obessively try to fix the issue and get bogged down
    - trying to correct myself or trying to get something to work. For example, (story with older person)
    - I had to learn to sometimes take a loss, digest and move on knowing that sometimes a loss is okay and that try to just be better on other problems moving forward.
    - and 2 apparently my face on web cams.
