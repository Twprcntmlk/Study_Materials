# What do you know about Bloomberg?
    - Bloomberg is a media and financial data and analytics and services company.
    - The company generates most of it's revenue from subscriptions and fees associated with Bloomberg terminals
    - as well as a variety of other services including Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Business, focused on venture capital, brokerage, and more.

# Tell me about recent financial news
    - Recently Trump launched DWAC, a social media firm ,which recently gained a lot of  value from memery and linger emotions.
    - I think this kind of buying on volatility and lack of fundamentals is dangerous and we are seeing this trend more and more with AMC and GameStop.
    - This sort of behaviour is being promoted through sites like reddit and twitter and I think it is something Bloomberg should take note of
    - because retail buys may start shying away from established new sources for none traditional one if money can be made from following reddit.
