## I want to talk about the sticking point you will have Experience. and I want you to Look At My History and Pattern of Work.
### High School
    - My time working at Veritas (SAT tutor center) where I became lead of 4 my fellow highschoolers building SAT tests.
### My Business
    - I took 2 years of what I learned from Quidsi Amazon and was able to turn it into a million dollar business and made top 50 sellers.
### My Hobbies
    - Continual Success in GO.
    - https://agagd.usgo.org/player/20360/
### MY Coding
    - My RPA and pandas projects saved 100s of hours and $100,000+ dollars. and I have no background in coding and noone asked me to do this.

### What do you know about Blackstone?
    Blackstone is the largest asset management company. Doing business in Real Estate, Private Equity, Hedge Fund Solutions and Credit and Insurance.
    (Do you want to hear about news related to Blackstone? Spandex, Retail Malls in Georgia)

### Tell me about yourself.
    - I'm a graduate of Univeristy of Illinois with a Bachelor in Accounting.  After college, I took a Data Analyst Role at Quidsi Amazon and learned the business and grew my passion for data. 2 years later started my own retail abritrage business where I deployed data to gain a competitive edge. ( I can talk about this more if you like) After about 7 years, I sold that business and started working at LG where I taught myself Python, Data Science, got my Six Sigma Black Belt and created 3 main internal tools ONE for invoice management, ANOTHER for leadtime and carrier tracking and ANOTHER for warehouse container tracking.
    - I realized that I had a real knack for coding and decided to join A/a and Iam now looking for that coding job where i can do the work that inspired my journey.

### Why Do you want to work at Blackstone?
    - Well foremost it's because of the job. When Andrew was talking about some of the tools he made I instantly connected because it was something I had done.
    - When he talked about the need to love data I was hooked because it is the reason and taught myself coding. It's why i built the 3 internal apps i mentioned in my free time .
    - I really love that blackstone pratices what you preach with "Value Creation through Responsible Investing" and you try to empower people at workd and do the same thing with your investments and I like being part of something good.
    - and Utlimately, Getting this job would be the culmination of many years of figuring out what makes me happy and excited for each day.
    - I love that fact that my work can unburden people and that really motivates me to work hard because I know that someone who will be able to get back that time.

### Tell me about a conflict you had.
    - I had my VP tell me when their is any dispute in business you simply go fact based of course that has some wrinkles.
    - I has a conflict with the owner of a company. I was in charge of essentially running the business.
    - We were headed towards trouble because of changing business environment. (I can elaborate if you like.)
    - so I did presentations and talked to him personally about the changes we need to make.
    - He would agree and say thing like if only i was 10 years younger but what i didn't understand was that he deeply wanted to retire
    - so changing and spending money was not something he wanted to do even if he knew it was what he needed to do.
    - In this case I had to learn to make best of a losing situation and learn to be okay with not winning.

### What is your greatest Strength
    - My greatest strength is ability to listen deeply, rethinking the question, and keep an open mind.
    - As a busines owner I had to be adaptive, be detailed oriented and be willing to hear hard truths and sometimes parse out the truth.
    And as a younger person, I had to be able to balance that line of listening to people who I had hired and be able to understand the wisdom they were bringing.
    So, My conflicts have taught me a lot about what it means to listen and  I really think my listening has allowed me to have strong communicate.
    (i have another example if you like)

### What is your greatest Weakness
    - My greatest weakness is my hatred of losing/failing. Sometimes I would fail and I would then sort of obessively try to fix the issue and get bogged down.
    - trying to correct myself or trying to get something to work. For example, (story with older person or ballon)
    - I had to learn to take a loss, digest it  and move on knowing that sometimes a loss is okay and that i need to just try to just be better on other problems moving forward.
    - and 2nd is apparently my face on web cams.
